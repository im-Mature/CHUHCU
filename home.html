<div class="class"> THE MARCOS REGIME </div>
<p>Known for his statement, “I shall declare Martial Law”, 
Ferdinand Marcos was head of state in the Philippines from 1966 to 1986.
 His dictatorship was put into an end by an uprising of people in EDSA, or
 Epifanio de los Santos Avenue. Before he became the president of the Philippines,
 he was a lawyer, a member of the Philippine House representatives (1949-1959), 
 and a member of the Philippine Senate (1959-1965).
 <br>
 <br>
Being the president of the Philippines, Marcos made ambitious public works to 
improve the life of the people in the Philippines. One of these, was a land 
reform program that purposed to alienate the powerful landowner elites. Another 
achievement was to be a part of, or rather, to have Philippines as one of the 
founding members of ASEAN or the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. Due to
 his good impacts during his presidency, he was elected again, making him the 
 1st president to be reelected. But with his second rule, things were beginning 
 to fall. The economic growth slowed, crime rates had increased and uprising 
 groups were formed like, The Communist Party of the Philippines and 
 the New People’s Army.
 <br>
 <br>
Due to the fact that communism has increasing threats, Marcos declared 
Proclamation 1081 putting the Philippines under Martial Law. He signed 
the law on Sept.21, 1972 and announced it in television on Sept.23, 1972
 at 7:15 pm. Orders were made to support martial law, like, putting all 
 powers to the hand of the president, arresting people who wants to take
 over the government, curfews and banning of groups. But after a few years, 
 Martial Law was put into an end on January 17, 1981.
